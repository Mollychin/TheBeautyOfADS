/**
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately,

 * on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 *
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which
 * causes all the following ones to be bad.
 *
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad.
 * Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to
 * the API.
