/**
 * In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a
 * new one with different size but keep its original data. You're given a matrix represented by a
 * two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column
 * number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively. The reshaped matrix need to be filled with
 * all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were. If the
 * 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix;
 * Otherwise, output the original matrix.
